    <intro>&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;It all comes together with the actual delivery of the instruction based on all your planning, reviewing, and evaluating of the past several weeks. Do not be nervous! This is a wonderful learning opportunity for both you the teacher and your learners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.231;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is also a wonderful opportunity to learn from each other. So, how did it go?  &lt;/span&gt;Tell us about what took place during your lesson, what worked well, and what did not work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.231;"&gt;Please spend a few moments summarizing your experience with teaching your lesson that included an OER. Also, attach your final lesson plan so your colleagues can see what you are talking about in your posting. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.231;"&gt;For those not currently teaching: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand that you may not currently be teaching and have come up with an alternative Module 7 activity.  Share your lesson plan with teachers in your program and get some feedback from them on what they see are some of the implementation challenges would be implementing your lesson.  You can also ask them how they might revise it based on their instructional strategies and student needs since it is open.   &lt;u1:p&gt;&lt;/u1:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
